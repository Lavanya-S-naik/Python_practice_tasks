## 📘 Python Practice Tasks
📌 Overview

This repository contains solutions to 5 Python practice tasks, covering different concepts in Python such as string operations, list comprehensions, NumPy arrays, and Pandas DataFrames.

The tasks are implemented in simple and beginner-friendly Python code, with outputs printed clearly for better understanding.

## 📝 Tasks
**1️⃣ Palindrome Checker**

  Write a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward). The string is taken from user input.

**2️⃣ Squares of Numbers**

  Given a list of numbers, use list comprehension to create a new list containing their squares.

**3️⃣ Students DataFrame**

  Create a DataFrame of 5 students with their marks and find out which students scored more than 80 marks.

**4️⃣ 5x5 Random Array**

  Create a 5x5 NumPy array with random integers between 1 and 100.

**5️⃣ Products DataFrame**

  Create a DataFrame of products with the following columns:

  Product Name

  Price

  Category

  Add a new column Discounted Price = 90% of Price.
  Finally, filter and display products that are cheaper than 500.

## 🚀 How to Run

  Clone the repository:
  
  git clone https://github.com/Lavanya-S-naik/Python_practice_tasks.git
  cd Python_practice_tasks


  Run the scripts in VS Code or any Python environment:
  
  python task1.py
  python task2.py
  ...
  python task5.py


If all solutions are in a Jupyter Notebook (PythonTasks.ipynb):

Open the notebook in VS Code (Jupyter extension) or JupyterLab.

Run the cells step by step to see results.
